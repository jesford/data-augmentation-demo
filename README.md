# image-augmentation-demo

Tutorial on image augmentations for computer vision.
Demonstrates use of the `albumentation` package to do standard
geometric, colorspace, kernel filter, and random erasing (Cutout) 
transformations. Gives examples of image mixing (Mixup and CutMix)
augmentations, and concludes with examples of techniques applied
by top teams in the Kaggle [Recursion Cellular Image
Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recursion-cellular-image-classification/)
Machine Learning competition.
