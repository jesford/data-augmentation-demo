# image-augmentation-demo

Tutorial on image augmentations for computer vision.

Demonstrates use of the [`albumentations`](https://albumentations.ai/)
package to do standard geometric, colorspace, kernel filter, and
random erasing (Cutout) transformations. Gives examples of image mixing
(Mixup and CutMix) augmentations, and concludes with examples of
techniques applied by top teams in the Kaggle [Recursion Cellular Image
Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recursion-cellular-image-classification/)
Machine Learning competition.

The notebook is intended to be rendered as slides using the RISE extension.

This talk was originally created for a presention to the SLC Python Meetup on June 3, 2020.

A more concise version of the talk was presented at PluralsightLIVE 2020, and can be accessed on the [pslive-version](https://github.com/jesford/image-augmentation-demo/tree/pslive-version) branch.
